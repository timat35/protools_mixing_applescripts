# in this script, I want to automatically set pan of a stereo track to -80 80..
# the pan interface is a dolby 5.1
# This is a first step, the goal at the end would be to set automatically to predefined value the pan for stereo - dolby - atmo..
# But this is too slow (considering working on a movie having at least 500 tracks..)
